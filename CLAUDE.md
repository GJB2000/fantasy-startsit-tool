# Project: [Tool Name TBD] — Fantasy Football Start/Sit Tool

## Overview
A web-based tool that helps fantasy football players decide who to start
each week when two or more players compete for the same roster spot.
Built for [Legitfootball]'s NFL/fantasy newsletter audience
(~16,000 subscribers today, targeting rapid growth). This is a competitive
build — one of several candidate tools being evaluated as a live, working
demo. The bar is a real, deployed tool using real current NFL data, not a
mockup.

## Who This Is For
Engaged fantasy football readers of [Legitfottball]'s newsletter — people
who already follow football closely and want a fast, trustworthy second
opinion on a tough lineup decision, delivered in a voice that fits the
newsletter's brand.

## Core User Flow (MVP)
1. User selects two (or more) players competing for the same roster spot
2. Tool pulls real, current stats and matchup data for each player
3. Tool runs a rules-based comparison (see "Recommendation Logic" below)
4. Tool displays a clear recommendation WITH reasoning — never just a
   verdict with no explanation

## Architecture
*(Fill in as the project takes shape — Claude Code should keep this
section current as real decisions get made.)*
- Framework: Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript), scaffolded via
  `create-next-app`
- Frontend: React 19, Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Backend: Next.js Route Handlers (`src/app/api/*`) — no separate
  backend service for now
- Database: TBD (not yet needed for MVP; add when persistence is
  required)
- Hosting: Vercel
- Version control: GitHub
- Football data source: SportsDataIO NFL API (Discovery Lab / free
  tier) — see [sportsdata.io](https://sportsdata.io)

Current state: v1 of the core start/sit comparison tool is live — real
player search, real SportsDataIO data, a rules-based recommendation
engine, and a working UI (see Conventions below for the actual file
layout). Out of scope so far: database/persistence, auth, K/DEF
positions, upcoming-schedule/next-opponent lookup (matchup difficulty
is computed against each player's most recent completed opponent, not
a hypothetical future one), multi-season history.

## Data Source Notes
- Football data comes from the SportsDataIO NFL API (Discovery Lab /
  free tier). API key is stored as the `SPORTSDATA_API_KEY` environment
  variable (`.env.local` locally, Vercel project env vars in
  production) — never hard-coded or committed to GitHub.
  (Note: an earlier version of this doc referenced football-data.org,
  which turned out to be a soccer-only API — not usable for this
  project.)
- Cache player/stat data rather than re-fetching on every page load —
  data doesn't need to be second-by-second fresh.
- Handle missing/edge-case data gracefully: bye weeks, injured players,
  rookies with limited history, mid-season trades. Never show a broken
  or blank result — show a clear, honest message instead.

## Recommendation Logic Philosophy
This is the most important section — the "brain" of the tool.
- Start with transparent, rules-based logic (not a black-box model).
  Every recommendation should be explainable in plain English.
- Factors to weigh (adjust weighting here as we tune it):
  - Recent performance (last 4 weeks) — weighted more heavily than
    season-long average
  - Opponent/matchup difficulty for the player's position
  - Injury status (Questionable/Doubtful/Out) — flag prominently, but
    don't treat "Questionable" as an automatic bench
  - [Add more factors here as they're decided]
- When it's a close call statistically, say so. Don't force false
  confidence.
- Every recommendation must include a short, human-readable "why."

## Voice & Tone
- This tool represents [Legitfootball]'s newsletter brand. Match that
  voice: [Clear, concise and simple].
- Explanations should read like a sharp, trusted friend giving advice —
  not a generic dashboard or a wall of stats.

## Conventions
- `src/lib/sportsdata/` — low-level SportsDataIO fetch client and typed
  data-access functions (`client.ts`, `players.ts`, `seasonStats.ts`,
  `weeklyStats.ts`, `byes.ts`, `timeframes.ts`, `positionDefense.ts`).
  Server-only (guarded via the `server-only` package) — never import
  this from a `"use client"` file. Each function owns its own Next.js
  `fetch` cache `revalidate` window; no separate cache layer or DB.
- `src/lib/recommendation/` — the pure, framework-agnostic scoring
  engine (`engine.ts`, `config.ts`, `types.ts`) plus one bridging file
  (`buildInput.ts`) that's the only impure piece, wiring `sportsdata`
  fetches into engine inputs. Tunable weights live in `config.ts` —
  adjust there as the logic gets tuned, per the Recommendation Logic
  Philosophy section above.
- `src/app/api/players` and `src/app/api/compare` — Route Handlers
  that orchestrate the two lib layers above and return trimmed JSON
  (never proxy raw upstream payloads, never leak the API key).
- `src/components/` — `StartSitTool.tsx` (client, owns state),
  `PlayerSearchInput.tsx` (client, debounced search), `ComparisonResult.tsx`
  (presentational). Reuses the existing `bg-background`/`text-foreground`/
  `font-sans` Tailwind tokens and `prefers-color-scheme` dark mode from
  `globals.css` — no new theme tokens or Tailwind config added.
- Season/week resolution is always computed live via `getSeasonContext()`
  (never hardcoded) — it correctly falls back to the last completed
  season during the NFL offseason.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — start local dev server (http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run start` — run the production build locally
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint
- No test runner configured yet

## Things to Avoid For Now
- No native mobile app — responsive web only
- No league/team import integrations
- No scaling/infrastructure work for large user volume — build for
  correctness and quality at small scale; scaling is a later, separate
  problem
- No dummy/placeholder data — always use real player data, even if it's
  from a prior completed season during the NFL offseason
